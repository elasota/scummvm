GUID resolution and structure loading:

Loading of objects in the mTropolis backend is done in multiple stages due to
the complex GUID resolution process, inline assets, and other things.  Here's

The first step to loading is to load data objects.  Data objects are JUST data,
but due to weird aspects of the data loading process (like the fact that asset
defs can appear anywhere) it's separate.

The second step is conversion of data objects into runtime objects and
formation of the scene structure.

The third step is "materialization" which performs two tasks: First, it clones
all aliased non-variable modifiers.  Second, it remaps all GUIDs to objects.
