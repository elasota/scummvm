Known script errors:

Forest:
Miniscript error in (59db9 'set iVol on GEN_SND_Set_iVol'): Failed to assign value to proxy

Triggers on startup.  Caused by kiCrixVolNormal and kiCrixVolLow variables being absent in
"Forest Intro" section.  The GUIDs are valid for the "Forest" section though, which is always
loaded.  Harmless?

Triggers on viewing the drawing pages in the "Journal" section.  Caused by F199_SetState being posted to an
image elmeent.  Harmless?  Is "cel" a valid attrib?



Bureau:
Miniscript error in (5d6349 '<init> on PE'): Failed to get a writeable reference to attribute 'cel'

Triggers on looking down at the chapter start.  Caused by script setting "cel" on a sound.
